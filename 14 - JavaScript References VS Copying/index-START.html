    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] ='jaziel' // if you update an array it will reference back to the original array. 

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way by using slice. (abit hacky)
    const team2 = players.slice(); 
  
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread (two of the best ways)
    const team4 = [...players]

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 1; 
    //this changes the original object. 

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let captainPants = Object.assign( {}, person, {age: 30});
    console.log(captainPants);
    

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. 
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    // Dee Clone performance using JSON.Parse
